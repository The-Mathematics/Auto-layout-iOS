# Auto-layout-iOS
Auto layout is a property that helps us constrain UIElements in our mobile app or web app to ensure it "fills" or "fits" different screen sizes and orientations

# Goal
The objective of this project is to introduce you to the core programming concepts like Constraints, Views and Stack Views that
will form a strong foundation for building most apps. 

# What it includes

* Using Swift constants and variables.
* Using collection types such as Swift arrays.
* Testing and debugging the app with the Xcode console.
