# Auto-layout-iOS
Auto layout is a property that helps us constrain UIElements in our mobile app or web app to ensure it "fills" or "fits" different screen sizes and orientations

# Goal
The objective of this project is to introduce you to the core programming concepts like Constraints, Views and Stack Views that
will form a strong foundation for building most apps. 

# What it includes
This commit contains two distinct projects which portray the basic idea of AUTO LAYOUTS.

* Calculator-Layout-iOS is an exercise app created by The App Brewery for students of their iOS Development cause
* Magic-8-Ball-iOS13 is a Magic 8 Ball app created by Me using UIElements I created to implement what I've learnt about using Constraints,Views and Stack Views

*Feel free to delete the constraints after understanding them and try adding constraints yourself to test what you've learnt

# Ideas Implemented

* Using Swift constants and variables.
* Using collection types such as Swift arrays.
* Testing and debugging the app with the Xcode console.
* implementing what i've learnt about Randomisation,Constraints, Views and Stack Views.
