# Magic 8 Ball

# Goal

The objective of this project is to introduce you to the core programming concepts like Variables, Constants, Arrays and Randomisation that
will form a strong foundation for building most apps. This app will teach you a lot of important programming knowledge, while building a neat
magical app called MAGIC 8 BALL

# What i've done

It's a Game app called MAGIC 8 BALL. This app takes the edge off making tough decisions, You can let the app make choices for you by clicking the 'ASK' Button and the app selects a random answer and displays it on screen. 
NOTE: App does not have editable labels where you input your questions,so for now asking the question in your mind would do 


# Ideas Implemented

* Create an app with behaviour and functionality.
* using Swift constants and variables.
* using collection types such as Swift arrays.
* implementing what i've learnt about randomisation and how to generate random numbers in Swift.
* Using constraints, views and stack views to constrain the layout 
* Testing and debugging the app with the Xcode console for different size classes and orientations.
